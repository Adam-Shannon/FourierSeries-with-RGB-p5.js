# FourierSeries-with-RGB-p5.js
Fourier series with sliders for rgb colours and number of circles made with p5 js in VS code

#code in index is used to link to the p5 js library 

#the code in sketch.js draws a wave using a fourier series with each itteration(each circle added)
bringing the produced wave closer to a square wave. This is controlled using the first slider on the page and the r, g,b
values of the wave and circles are controlled via the other sliders(commented out by defualt).
